Wet Footsteps
Bridget Crow, one of the earliest wandering witches,
fell and broke a priceless crystal sphere she borrowed
from the neighboring coven. This was on account of her
having crossed a stream, and slipping on her wet clothes.
Ever since, it's traditional for witches to never go anywhere
with wet clothes. Since those early days, the first spell
fledgling witches learn has been "siccari" - to dry.
